As an adult human with strong intelligence I want to answer questions so that:

- I can answer complicated questions
- Answers are significantly better than google
- I can understand how answers are being computed
- I can contribute to answers and have some benefits from efforts
- My personal knowledge and data appear in the results
- Search works offline on my terminal, mobile, and desktop
- Privacy does not leak and my data remains mine
