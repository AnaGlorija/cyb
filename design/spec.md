# One app to rule them all

I have 25 year experience of using computers. I used a lot of programs in my life. And after 25 years of using all these programs I can state that my experience sucks. I sincerely want to fix this. I started analyse how I use my programs and why. Finally I decided to narrow the scope of search to the following question: Which programs I cant live without? To my surprise the list is quite short: gmail, google search and drive, youtube, twitter, amazon, and telegram. Together these seven web apps form my environment. But my experience sucks. All these apps share one particular pattern. They share 3 essential functions which are messages, feeds and contacts. The only app which do not follow this pattern is google search. That explain me a lot - I ask questions and have results which primary unaware of the most important staff for me. Data is fragmented and much of data is locked. I use 5 different icons for essentially the same stuff. So asked a question is that possible to have one consistent experience which will replace all these programs at once. It turns out that the app that will solve all the tasks at once does not have to be complicated. So I decide to start the design of such app from defining philosophic consideration, conceptual semantics and functional bounds. I hope this doc will help not only with initial implementation, but with advancing the idea further.

## Idea

We have to involve our players in the process of saving the world from greedy corps and corrupt governments


Combine game concepts and usual concepts of meatspace. We have to bring cool ideas of the blockchain through adding metaphors to the salad without fear.
