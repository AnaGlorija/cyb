# One app to rule them all

I have 25 year experience of using computers. I used a lot of programs in my life. And after 25 years of using all these programs I can state that my experience sucks. I sincerely want to fix this. I started analyse how I use my programs and why. Finally I decided to narrow the scope of search to the following question: Which programs I cant live without? To my surprise the list is quite short:
- google search
- gmail
- drive
- youtube
- twitter
- github
- telegram

Together these seven web apps form my environment. But my experience sucks. All these apps share one particular pattern. They share 3 essential functions which are messages, feeds and contacts. The only app which do not follow this pattern is google search. That explain me a lot: I ask questions and have results which primary unaware of the most important staff for me. Data is fragmented and much of data is locked. I use 6 different icons for essentially the same stuff.

Another thing I realised after nearly 10 years of using crypto is that trading become kinda basic and essential for my survival. So I decided to combine functions of bisq (otc) and 1inch (on-chain) exchanges in one convenient screen with one significant limitation that the medium of exchange will be CYB, because otherwise it will be technically infeasible to implement. CYB as the only medium of exchange to be honest is enough for our task.

So I asked a question is that possible to have one consistent experience which will replace all these programs at once? It turns out that the app that will solve all the tasks at once does not have to be complicated. So I decide to start the design of such app from defining philosophic consideration, conceptual semantics and functional bounds. I hope this doc will help not only with initial implementation, but with advancing the idea further.

### Hall of Fame
Define your Heroes of the Great Web

- Hall

=> Become Hero of Great Web
=> onClick: Stake, Unstake, Restake

- Incubator
=> Become Hero of Great Web

- Jail
=> onClick: Unstake, Restake

### University
Learn new skills

Understand how the one can develop self after joining the force

Citizen init:
- Get CYB
- Stake CYB
- Introduce myself
- Follow the story
- Cyberlink
- Follow the discussion
- Send confidential mail
- Send private message
- Create the story
- Post to story
- Vote for proposal

Hero path:
- get in the way
- one month with high uptime
- get basic point of the stake
- become a hero
- become superhero
- become imperator

Master path:

Evangelist path:

Hacker path:

### Bazaar
Simplify value exchange

Currently key purpose of bazaar is to create internal and over-the-counter liquidity for CYB. Hence all interface considerations have to be around this goal.

The philosophy behind bazaar is to be as dumb as possible and follows 3 basic principles:
- must not require arbitrage. Because it's possible thanks to 2of2 scheme with delayed return.
- must not require integrations. Trade details have to be exchanged using encrypted messages.
- must not require administration. Trade directions have to be dynamic without any third party.

The following exchange directions have to be initially supported:
- Physical cash
- Gold and silver
- Electronic payments
- Leading crypto
- Internal tokens

List of tokens is managed by simple shelling game in which proposers stake tokens for every change in the registry.

### Tower
Inspire content creators

Masters with the most rank of created files

Cre

The most payed masters What is matter is total value of CYB which came to the account with memo field of the created files by account.
